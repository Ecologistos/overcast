This is a server where your roleplaying is your responsibility.
You will not see long-winded rule sets, but you must abide by a simple maxim - do what makes sense for your character to do.
Open hostility between warring factions is not uncommon, but shooting on sight is a very situational thing.

Remember: our rules may not be written in paragraphs, but there is a model of expected behaviour with the goal of an atmospheric experience.
